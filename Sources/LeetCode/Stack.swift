/// Simplify path
///
/// Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash `'/'`, transform this path into its **simplified canonical path**.
///
/// In Unix-style file system context, a single period `'.'` signifies the
/// current directory, a double period `".."` denotes moving up one directory
/// level, and multiple slashes such as `"//"` are interpreted as a single
/// slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the
/// previous rules (like `"..."`) as valid names for files or directories.
///
/// The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:
///
/// - It must start with a single slash `'/'`.
/// - Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash `'/'`.
/// - It should not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it's the root directory.
/// - It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or
///   parent directories.
///
/// Return the new path.
